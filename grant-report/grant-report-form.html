                  <strong><i>*Reminder:</i></strong> Applicants must provide at least the dollar-for-dollar match to be reimbursed in whole for their project. Overmatch from categories listed in the contract budget must also be provided if such expenses were incurred or in kind contributions/volunteer time documented. Match & overmatch must be from non-federal sources, which include: foundation or private-sector grants, the grantee or partner organization's funds, project partners, in-kind non-cash contributions from professionals and/or volunteers/staff ($25.25/hour, $12.50/hour students participating as part of an enrolled-course assignment, verified hourly rate for professionals - please note that timesheets MUST be signed by the volunteer or submitted electronically through the QR code provided to the organization) or any combination thereof. In-kind contributions may be labor directly related to the project, services, materials, equipment, supplies, and/or travel expenses necessary for project objectives. Purchases of real property, overhead & general administrative costs don't count toward match. Matching & overmatching contributions must begin after the contract's start date and cannot be dated after the contract's conclusion.
